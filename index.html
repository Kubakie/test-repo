        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>

        <p>Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
            In a world of magnets and miracles
            Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
            The ringing of the division bell had begun
            Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
            Do they still meet there by the Cut
            There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
            Running before times took our dreams away
            Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
            To a life consumed by slow decay
        </p>
        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <p>The grass was greener
            The light was brighter
            With friends surrounded
            The nights of wonder
        </p>
        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
        <p>Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
            To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
            Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
            Dragged by the force of some inner tide
            At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
            We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
        </p>
