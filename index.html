        <h1>High hopes</h1>
        <p class="autor">by David Gilmour( Pink Floyd) &amp; Polly Samson</p>
        <p>Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
            In a world of magnets and miracles
            Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
            The ringing of the division bell had begun
            Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
            Do they still meet there by the Cut
            There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
            Running before times took our dreams away
            Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
            To a life consumed by slow decay
        </p>
